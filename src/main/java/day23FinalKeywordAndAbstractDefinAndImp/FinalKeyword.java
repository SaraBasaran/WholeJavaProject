    /*

    Final Keyword can be used for methods, variables and classes.

    1) Final methods means its body cannot be updated and cannot be overriden. ==>finished nobody can touch or override
    2) Final variables==> a) you have to initialize it, assign a value to it. Once you create a final variable with default value java doesnot accept it
    It is a must you have to assign a value to it.
           final int x; ==>java will complain
           final int x=12; ==>no complain

                        b) After initializing, the value of the "final" variable" cannot be updated. For ex;
                        final static int x =12;

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        x=13;

          3) If a class is "final class", it cannot have a child class but "final class" can be a child class...
          For Intv.s==> Final cla. can be child classes but they can not have child classes.
          a)All Wrapper classes are final classes==> there is no parent child relationship between wrapper classes
          b) All immutable classes are final classes so String is a final class.

    When you create a class you can make access modifier "public" or "default".
    ===============================================================================
    1)String class is "immutable", but sometimes we need "mutable" Strings bec. of that Java created
    String Builder and String Buffer classes. All 3 Strings will give you String.

    2)When you use "String str1= "Java"; to create a String, Java creates a "String pool" in "Heap" memory
    and puts the str1 object inside the String pool.

    3) When you create a new String by using "String str2="Jack"; ==> Java will check the String pool if there is
    an obj. whose value is same then Java doesnot create a new container, just points the existing one. Java does that to save memory

    4) When multiple pointers point the same object, any update on the obj. will affect the all other Strings but we donot want it.
    To prevent all Strings to be updated Java created "immutability". In "immutability" existing obj.s will not be updated, Java will create a new
    obj. with the new value then change the pointer to the new obj. Just the one you want to update will have a new pointer.

    5) If you want to create diff. objects with the same value you have to use "String newObj= new String("value");==> same obj. with another container

    6) If ANY obj. does not have any pointer , Garbage collector will delete it automatically to make the memory clean.

    7) The difference between "==" and "=":
    "==" for String values ==> to compare Strings, it will check the value and address
    If both are same you will get true.
    "=" ==> will check the value and give value if correct
    String valueA.equals().valueB ==>just checks if the value is same or not (not the addresses). The outcome false or true.

      When we work with Strings, we work with the values mostly. Therefore, we use "equals()" to compare Strings.

     **In Java, String class and Wrapper classes are immutable (Integer, Double, Boolean, Char...)

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        String str1= "Java";
        //we have two types of memory. Stack and Heap memory. Inside heap java created a String pool and address
        //of that string in stack memory.

        String str2= "Java"; //==>Java will go to String pool and check the pool to check any container
                            // whose container has the same value java doesnot create a new cont. to save memo
                             //and just creates a new reference directing to the same container.This is perfect but
                             //that system has a problem
        //str1= "Apex";

        //
        // ==>if java changes str1 to "Apex" then str2 will be "Apex" as well.To save memo java
       // may cause some problem. To make str2 as "Java", once the change is done str2 reference will be
        //updated. So, when you change str1 java will accept the update for str1 differently from str2.
        /*If you donot use immutability once you want to change the value of String then all of the same value holding
        Strings will be changed too.
        **To compare String use "equals" method==> str1 ==str2...
        Double "==" checks value and address of the String.

         str1==str2 are same for ref. and value
         */

        System.out.println(str1==str2);//true
        //if we type just one "=" java checks the value of the String
        //if we change str2 ="Apex"; then the result is false

        str1="Apex";

        System.out.println(str1==str2);

        /*If you make Strings "immutable" then when you change the value of the first given String will affect the other
        copy of the String too.When you update str1 then str2 will be updated too. If you want to check both ref and value
        you should type double equals sign ==> "=="
        but most of the time we need to check just the value for which it is enough to use single equals sign ==> "=".

        Immutable means "unchangeable" after creating String java does not allow you to change the "immutable" Strings
        Once a String is created and another and another String variable is created with the same value then Java will give the same
        ref. address for that String.

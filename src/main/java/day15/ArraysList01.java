        //So, there is lists usage in arrays class.For ex; the months of a year is stable we can use arrays.
        //But if we have changeable values of arrays then we should use lists.After typing codes for a school
        //registration process if you need 10 more seats for registrations by using lists you can store multiple elements
        //If you are sure about the number of elements use arrays
        //**But if you are not sure about the number of elements use lists.
        //Arrays can have primitive and references of the non-primitive data.

    //String class is immutable.
        /*The diff. between string class and string buffer.

        1)String class gives you immutable strings. If you need "Mutable Strings" you can use "StringBuilder"
        or "StringBuffer" classes==> In string class original value cannot be updated but if it is mutable
        java will automatically update the "StringBuilder" or "StringBuffer" objects.

        2)When Java was created, Java created "StringBuffer" Class. But then in Java 1.5 version, (for now we use java 17) "StringBuilder" came to the
        stage.StringBuffer is before Stringbuilder...
        3)"StringBuffer" is multi-thread and syncronized but "StringBuilder" is not multithread and synchronized.
        StringBuffer has more features but even StrinBuilder has been created later than but StringBuilder is fASTER THAN StringBuffer bec. it has less features.
        Java did that to provide faster mutable Strings to developers.

        4) When to use "String", "StringBuilder", "StringBuffer".
        String: If you want to operate with small amount of the data use "String".//using state names of USA==>small data for java.
        StringBuilder: If you need single thread operations with large data in fast pays use "StringBuilder"...
        StringBuffer: MultiThread operations with large amount of data needs "StringBuffer".
